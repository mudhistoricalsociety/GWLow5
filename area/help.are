    { o }	 Dragons once used to rule the realm of mankind. Unfort-
     |-|	 unately, man's fear of the different and powerful caused
     |\|	 man to engage in a crusade to destroy and eliminate these
     |\|	 powerful and mystical creatures.
     |\|	 As each day went by, the population of dragons quickly
 /---------\ declined.  The powerful council of dragons decided that
 |_________| the only way for the race to come close to surviving was
     |o|	 to cross breed with mankind.
     |=|	 The new cross breeds possessed the mystical power to
     | |	 transform into dragons yet, be accepted by mankind in
     | |	 their human form.
     | |	 The last of the Elder Dragons, Vaevictis could forsee the
     | |	 end of the race of the pure breds.  As a result, he used
     | |	 a powerful dragon spell to prevent the newer cross breeds
     | |	 from ever aging like their predecessors and thus never
     | |	 able to become as powerful as their predecessors.

0 CLASS CLASSES~
As of right now you may choose vampire, drow, demon, ninja and monk.
Werewolves are currently in the testing stage.  Ptesters are already
selected and in place.  DON'T ASK, you won't get a spot.
~

0 ARTIFACT ARTIFACTS~
Here is how the artifact code works the artifacts load up on 
certian mobs type arti to see them. If you kill the mob you get the
artifact, however when you quit the artifact will be droped and someone
else can pick it up. You cannot give the artifact to anyone else cause it
wont allow you to give an artifact. The mobs will also not dupe the
artifacts. Have fun.

~
0 MONK MONKS~

Monks are servants of God.  They are masters of the body and spirit.
Defensive in nature, a monk spends his or her life practicing the
mystical arts.  God grants monks special abilities that allow
them to compete with the evil Supernatual creatures they aim
to smite.
Monks improve their skills via the learn command.

bracers, glove or cloak each create a piece of Monk EQ at the cost
of 60 primal

For more in depth information, See the following helps:
MONKABILITIES, MONKCHI, MONKBLOCK, MONKCOMBO, MONKFOCUS
~

0 MONKCHI~

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~

By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.
~

0 MONKBLOCK~

A monk's block counter allows him to parry blows much better.
This counter increments whenever a monk parries a blow.
The max block counter is 150, and the higher it gets, the
better the monk parries.  After the fight stops, the block
counter will soon reset to 0.
~

0 MONKFOCUS~

Elite monks have the ability to focus the power of God
into his or her own special attacks.  After a monk has
gained focus points, he or she must use them to perform
special attacks that have devastating effects.  The only
downside to these attacks is that it takes a monk a
very long time to recover the focus required to do such
extraordinary feats.
~

0 MONKABILITIES~
Monks have four special abilities granted to them by God.
Each ability has four levels, which cost 500k exp each.
For more info on the Abilities,
See Help: 'MONKSPIRIT' 'MONKCOMBAT' 'MONKBODY' and 'MONKAWARENESS'
~

0 MONKSPIRIT~

Level 1 - Blinding Agony. This power allows the monk to hurl
a ball of pure evil at a foe.  It blinds the foe, and prevents
him or her to flee or recall.

Level 2 - Natural Harmony (auto).  This power allows the monk to
absorb the evil of someone who attacks him or her and channel
them into energy, which heals the Monk.

Level 3 - Healing Touch.  This power allows the monk to imbue his
target with the essence of God, healing his or her wounds.

Level 4 - Death Touch. This power allows the monk to give his victim a
deadly disease which cripples and wounds him or her.
~

0 MONKAWARENESS~

Level 1 - Nightsight

Level 2 - Shadowsight

Level 3 - Truesight

Level 4 - Scry
~

0 MONKBODY~

Level 1 - Adamantium Hands.  This power allows the monk's hands to become
incredibly hard, like adamantium.  This allows the monk to do more damage
and parry blows with his or her bare hands.

Level 2 - Body of Stone (Auto).  At this mastery of the body, the monk's
body is as hard as a stone, causing him or her to take reduced damage.

Level 3 - Spiritpower.  This power allows the monk to channel his or her
energy into offensive attacks, significantly raising his or her hitroll
and damroll.

Level 4 - The Glow (Auto).  Only a true master of the body has this
ability.  The monk's power is so great that his or her hands glow
brightly with the power of God and the monk's holy spirit.  The 
effect of this glow is varied, but often dangerous.

~

0 MONKCOMBAT~

This ability improves the monk's combat ability per level.
Each level gives the monk more knowledge of combat,
allowing him or her to do more damage, hit more often, and
parry and dodge more.
~
0 MONKCOUNTER~

The monk's block counter is a very important part of a monk's blocking.
The block counter increases everytime a monk parries a blow.  The
higher a monk's block counter, the better the monk can parry blows.
The block counter resets shortly after fights.
~

0 KINGDOM KINGDOMS CLAN CLANS~

There are no longer clans they are called kingdoms.
Kingdoms are ruled by kings who can induct a person of any class.
This means He/She can have demons, werewolves, vampires and so on in
his/her kingdom.

* Clanlist	- Lists the Kingdoms and their stats
* Ktalk	- Talk to other members of the Kingdom
* Prince	- Prince a member so they can Induct
* Induct	- Induct new members to the Kingdom
* Clannable	- Makes players able to be inducted
* Kingdom	- Shows stats for members of a Kingdom
* Krecall	- Recall to your Castle's Recall Spot

Currently kingdoms are all headed by imms, this will change once we
hit the beta testing stage.

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.
~
0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

-1 ALLOW~
I got bored, so I added race exclusive allow commands..

Werewolf - Submit
Vampire  - Vampallow
Demon    - Soulsell
Warlock  - Dedicate

They replaced Vampire... *clap*
~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

0 ANIMALISM~
ANIMALISM
Animalism allows empathy with and power over the animal world, as well as 
the animal within, and embodies the Beast within the soul of every 
Cainite.  Those with animalism can understand and soothe the passions of 
animals and control the actions of such creatures by touching the the 
heart of the beast within them all.

Sweet Whispers (Whisper [Target] {Order})
This ability allows the user to ask for the aid of animals in their own 
tongue.  Though animals will not always obey the order they often do.

The Beckoning (Beckon [Target])
A vampire with this power level can reach out to find the mind of an 
animal and summon it to him.

Song of Serenity (Serenity [Target])
This represents the ability to soothe the spirit of the angered - both 
animal and otherwise.  It will make the target more favourably disposed 
and thus unlikely to attack one using this power.

Sharing of spirits (Share [Target])
This is a power which allows a kindred to actually 'share' an animals 
mind with it - almost as if the user were riding the beast's mind.

The Beast Within (Frenzy [Target])
The opposite of Song of serenity this will send the target into an 
instant furious rage attacking everything that comes within reach.  It is 
often best for the user to leave as quickly as possible after this power 
is employed.

~

0 ANSI COLOUR~
Syntax: ansi

This will show things in colour.  Spells will appear in their appropriate 
colour, and important messages will be highlighted.  Your exp (or opponents
condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
Scaled colour is represented as follows:

Cyan   : Maximum.
Yellow : 75% to just below maximum.
Green  : 50% to just below 75%
Blue   : 25% to just below 50%
Red    : Below 25%

Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.

0 AREAS COMMANDS SOCIALS~
Syntax: areas

AREAS shows you all the areas in the game, with the author's name and the
levels of the mobs that inhabit that area.

SOCIALS shows you all the social commands available to you.
~

0 ARMOR~
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character
by 20 points.
~

5 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

0 AUSPEX~
AUSPEX
This Discipline is one of extrasensory awareness, empathy and 
perception.  Those using this Discipline tend to be strongly affected by 
environmental phenomena.  Vampires with Auspex are able to see and sense 
things most other people cannot.  Auspex is the opposing Discipline to 
Obfuscate, and they cancel out many of each others powers.

This Discipline allows the following basic powers:

Heightened senses (No syntax)
The vampire possesing this power will automatically be able to detect 
those attempting to be inobtrusive - most notably players and mobs using 
hide and sneak.

Aura Perception (Readaura [target])
Gives the user information on the target, including hit points, ac and if a 
Player Hit/Damroll.

Spirits Touch (Readaura [object])
A similar power to above but it works on objects revealing their powers 
to the user.

Unveil the shrouded mind (Telepathy [target])
Allows you to eavesdrop on another player effectively scanning their 
surface thoughts and allowing you to see their commands.

Abandon earthly form (Step sideways)
At this level the cainite can travel astrally into the Near Umbra 
existing only as an astral projection of himself until he leaves the Umbra.

~

0 AUSPEXADVANCED~
AUSPEXADVANCED
Sense Emotion (Emotion)
This power is similar to the level two power Aura perception but instead 
you automatically scan everybody in the room you are in.

Soul Scan (Scry [target])
With this it is possible to detect another players or mobs whereabout's 
MUD-wide.  This assumes that the scryee has no supernatural protection.

~

-1 AVATAR AVATARS~
Ok what avatar means is that you are saying that you will player-kill and that 
you can be player-killed (or at lest they can try right:). Note if you train 
avatar and decide you are not ready well tuff shit. You will have to either be 
pk'ed or find a mob that will kill you. to kill a player you need to have a 
slicing weapon. the syntax is decapp <person> Note if you are a werewolf
you use tear <person>

Good Luck!

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

4 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout <message>

Slam
Roar

Bear Charge
Unfair Play

~

0 BEAST~
Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.
~

0 BLESS~
Syntax: cast bless <character>

target character by +1 each.

Immovability: You are able to shrug off blows that would knock out most people.
burrow: Alows you to travel to a werewolf if they are willing
Rend  Increased chance of critical hit

~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

~

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~
Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from God.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

This spell enables the caster to create a familiar, which can be either a

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

  allows the mage to create their own spells from scratch.  Such a task is 
  very difficult as well as time consuming, however.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- NEW NEWS -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	Ok all, time for things to change around here.  Attitudes need to
have some serious adjustments around here and it's high time for you
to start showing some respect to those who are putting this here for
you.
	#1 - Start helping newbies get their feet under them, and stop this
damn bullshit capping newbies 3-4 times within their first damn hour.
Bottom line, you chase the newbies off, you get less status around here
in the long run.
	#2 - REMORT - Classes are not currently set up for remort, hence, it
IS NOT POSSIBLE.  And right now and for the near future, we aren't even
going to consider working on it.  I'm sick of repeating myself.
	#3 - Satan's Souls has got alot of problems with attitudes, they no
longer have a kingdom guardian as he got scared of the wrath of the
god's and hightailed his ass out of there leaving only a note behind.
The A ##1 king of attitude is Montelbo.  Marlin is offering 300 qp for

out as a newbie and when you kill five mobs u become a mortal. Once  mortal 
you can train your char intill you think you are ready to survie other
chars and then youu may train avatar and enter the killing field.

A few things you should check out are the folowing:

1 OBFUSCATE~
OBFUSCATE
Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

Kindred with this power gain the following advantages.

Cloak of Shadows (Shadow)
This ability conceals the user but this is only a very weak power and is 
useless if the Cainite is in motion.

Unseen Prescence (Unseen)
This ability is more powerful than the first level and allows movement 
whilst it is activated.  The user is not actually invisible but all those 
in his area simply fail to notice him.

Mask of a Thousand Faces (Mask [player])
This power allows a vampire to create an illusion surrounding his body 
which gives him the appearance of another player.  This power does not 
affect equipment and cannot be used to duplicate mobs.

Vanish from the minds eye (Vanish)
The most powerful cloaking power this can be activated in front of others 
and you will simply disappear as far as they are concerned.

Cloak the Gathering (Gathering)
Gives the ability to use obfuscate powers on others in the room.

Also See 'help obfuscateadvanced'
~

0 OBFUSCATEADVANCED~
OBFUSCATEADVANCED
Advanced Obfuscate powers are largely used to protect the vampire from 
the powers of the rival discipline Auspex. The most amusing of these 
powers is Soul Mask where you can convince weak vampires with auspex 
that you are in fact considerably weaker than they(Ho Ho Ho).

Mind Blank (Blank)
Protects the user from the Auspex Scry ability.

Cloak (Cloak)
Protects the user from the Auspex Readaura ability.

Soul mask(Soul) 
Gives the user the ability to change the details that others see when 
employing Readaura.

Create Name (Create [name])
This power gives you the power to create aliases.

Memories fading glimpse (Fade)
When this power is activated all mobs will find that the user simply 
becomes an unusaul anomaly in their memory - they will have almost no 
idea of you existence whatsoever.
~

0 OBTENEBRATION~
OBTENEBRATION
Obtenebration allows the user to manipulate the powers of darkness.  By 
using their powers they are able to switch between the normal world and 
the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

Shadow Play (Shade)
This is not so much any kind of supernatural power as it is a simple 
understandin of concealment in shadows.  This power gives the user an 
increased ability to Hide and Sneak.

Eyes of the night (Shadowsight)
Gives a lasombra absolutely perfect night vision and allows them to see 
into the near umbra.

Shroud of the Night (Shroud)
This power gives the ability to summon shadows into a room or area which 
will blind all those with natural eyesight.

Arms of the abyss (Abyss [target])
One of the most feared powers of the Lasombra is this, which calls forth 
tendrils of pure night entrapping it's victims and hindering their actions.

ShadowStep (Shadowstep [target])
Shadowstep to anybody who has there notravel on.

Shadowsight 
See people who blend themselves into the shadow plane.
type help "obtenebrationadvanced" which was created by some
god, for more info on obtenebration.

  being removed from the game and any further action deemed appropriate by
  myself or the God(s) concerned.

* Multiplaying is banned!

  Anyone caught multiplaying will have ALL of the concerned characters deleted
  or any lesser penalty deemed appropriate by the immortal dealing with it.
  Multiplaying will be punished by a site ban that will last for 1 - infinite
  days. So don't do it.

* No spamming any channels

  This is unfriendly and upsets people. The penalty for this is that the 
  offending player will be silenced for a period determined by the immortal.
  Repeated offenses will be punished with deletion, denying of all your chars,
  or banning of your site.
  
* No purposeful crashing of the mud.

  Deliberate crashing of the mud will cause you to be denied or possibly
  deleted and may even end up in your site being prevented from connecting
  to the mud (banned). 

[ALSO SEE HELP POLICY2]
~

1 POLICY2~
* Torsoing is not allowed.

  Continually morting a char for an extended period of time takes away the
  enjoyment of the game for others.  Cap or be gone.  If you mort, and leave,

  The imms are here doing a service for all, show them a little respect.  If
  you've got nothing nice to say to them, say nothing.

* Setting Trans items to Kingdom Castles is banned.

  Setting a transporter in or in the general vicinity of a Castle will bring
  down severe penalties.  Eventually the kingdom castles will have more of a
  purpose than just a place for the kingdoms portals.  Please respect this.

* Keep the foul language down.

  We're not going to all out ban swearing and cursing, but, overuse of foul
  language IS banned and against the policy of this mud.  Please respect the
  other people playing and limit your cursing.  Besides, relying on foul
  language is the sign of a weak mind.

  expect preferential treatment no matter who you know.
~

1 POLICY3~

    Absolutely NO saccing of relics in mobs, on corpses, etc.  If you are caught
    purposely saccing another players relics, you will be forced to remove all and

~

0 PRESENCE~
PRESENCE
A vampire with the presence discipline is execptionally attractive and 
appealing to others.  People want to be around the vampire, to bask in 
the brilliant light he sheds.  They never need make any sort of overt or 
deliberate action, for presence is a natural aspect of one's personality.


Awe (No Syntax)
You carry with you an aura of friendliness which means that creatures 
have difficulty bringing themselves to hurt you and people react well to 
your presence.

Dread Gaze (Gaze [Target])
Only the strong in will can meet the gaze of a vampire wioth this level 
of Presence and not flee.  Even then they will suffer from a feeling of 
temerity which will affect their actions.

Entrancement (Trance [Target])
Those who you wish to befriend will always fall over themsleves to help 
you and carry out your each and every whim or desire.

Summon (Summon [Target])
This works in much the same way as the summon spell but it's affect is 
felt all over the MUD.  Once the personality of a player has been felt by 
the summoner he can locate and then call that person wherever they may be 
or whatever they be doing.

Majesty (No syntax)
Your personality has such a feeling of power that it overbears almost 
everyone.  You seem so powerful that even players who could best you in 
combat will not be able to contemplate harming you in any way.
~

0 PRESERVE~
Syntax: cast preserve <object>

This spell will stop the specified object decaying.  It's primary use is 
on severed body parts, which can be stored away safely in case the player 
should loose any limbs in combat.
~

0 PRIMAL~
Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one use, and is generally used for very powerful 
spells, such as 'voodoo' (which uses 5 points) and 'quest' (which uses 
between 1 and 50 points).
~

-1 PROMPT CPROMPT~
This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.
The following options are available:

%a %A = Alignment (word/numeric).   %b %B = Beast/Blood.
%c    = Armour Class.               %f %F = Condition of opponent/tank. 
%g    = Gold.                       %h %H = Current hp/Max hp.          
%m %M = Current mana/Max mana.      %n %N = Name of opponent/tank.      
%p %P = Plus Hitroll/Plus Damroll.  %q    = Quest points.
%r %R = Room name/Rage.             %s %S = Status (word/numeric).
%v %V = Current move/Max move.      %x    = Exp.
%z = Primal.
To switch your prompt on and off, use 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.
For some examples, type 'help prompts'.
~

0 PROMPTS~
There are many possible prompts, and everyone will have their own 
favoured setups.  However, to get you going, here are some examples:

Original normal prompt: [%x exp] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Original combat prompt: [%f] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]
Vampire prompt: [%B Blood] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Werewolf prompt: [%R Rage] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Combat prompt: [%N:%F/%n:%f]
Stat prompt: [%xX] [+%pHIT/+%PDAM] [%cAC] [%hH/%mM/%vV]

Remember, you can switch between the default prompts and your customised
prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.
~

0 PROTEAN~
PROTEAN
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

The powers available to this Discipline are as follows:

Gleam of the red eyes (Nightsight)
Allows the Cainite almost perfect night vision

Wolf Claws (Claws)
Razor sharp claws extend from your fingertips doing enhanced damage in 
hand to hand combat.

Earth Meld (Meld)
With this power you can become one with the very earth protecting you 
from physical attacks and Sunlight.

Shadow of the Beast (Change Wolf/Bat)
Assume the shape of a great dire wolf (extra hp and Hit/Dam) or a Bat 
(Flight but limited combat ability).

Se also: 'HELP PROTEANADVANCED'
~

0 PROTEANADVANCED~
PROTEANADVANCED
Powerful users of protean have access to the following powers and Truly 
ancient Vampires can use the legendary ability to transform into the 
feared form of the Sun itself.

Form of Mist (Change mist)
Use this to become a floating mist which can move at will but only be 
attacked by other mist's.

Flesh of Marble (Marble)
Reduces damage taken by 50% - note that this does not include damage from 
fire or sunlight.

Spiritform (Spirit)
With this level of Protean the Kindred can become an ethereal creature 
with the power of flight.

Movement of the Slowed Body (No Syntax)
Even whilst terribly injured a Vampire with this power can still perform 
actions.

Dual Form (Dual)
This allows you to divide your very body into two clones with almost 
identical abilities.

Body of the Sun (Sun)
With the most powerfukl level of Protean a Vampire can imitate that which 
he fears most - the light of the Sun itself.  This form allows complete 
invulnerability to both fire and Sunlight.
~

0 PROTECTION SANCTUARY~
Syntax: cast protection
Syntax: cast sanctuary  <character>

The PROTECTION spell reduces the damage taken from any attack by an evil
creature by one quarter.

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any attack
by one half.

These spells may be used simultaneously for cumulative effect.
~

4 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
Syntax: purge <character>

PURGE is used to clean up the world.  PURGE with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  PURGE with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

PURGE will not get rid of PC's.
~

7 QTRUST~
Syntax: qtrust <character> <on/off>

A player with qtrust on is allowed to use the QUEST command to change the 
name/long/short descriptions on an object, as well as change the wear 
location.
~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 QUESTSPELL~
Syntax: cast quest

This spell creates a quest card.  The quest-point value of the card is 
the same as the amount of primal the caster has at the time of casting 
(and this primal is used up during the casting of the spell).  No more 
than 50 primal will be used on any one casting of this spell.

For information on how to complete the card, type 'help complete'.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

0 SERPENTIS~
SERPENTIS
Serpentis is the art of temptation and corruption.  Vampires with this 
Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run 
their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.

Eyes of the Serpent (Serpent [target])
The eyes of a Setite are a gleaming gold mesmerizing those who are 
foolish enough to look into them for long.  Setites use this to 
immobilize their prey - preventing them from moving or running away.

Tongue of the Serpent (Tongue)
Similar to the kick command this deal's an extra attack in combat as the 
Setite's tongue elongates and strikes it's victim.

Mummify (Cocoon)
The Setite wraps themselves in a cocoon which though it prevents any 
actions on their part also protects them completely from sunlight and 
fire.  Setites use this only when essential - caught outside just before 
dawn.

Form of the Serpent (Serpent)
With this ability the vampire can actually transform their entire body 
into that of a gigantic serpent.

Heart of Darkness (Darkheart)
Removes the heart from the vampire or it's victim rendering the target 
completely immune to being staked.

SERPENTISADVANCED

powerful of their disciplines reflect this.

Temptation (Tempt [target])
Increases the likelihood of the target's frenzying and gradually 
resembling the beast he is.  This power is howeveer almost useless on the 
pure of heart.

Obsession (Obsession [target])
A minor form of insanity can be imbued upon the target giving them an 
addiction to a certain substance or action - Alchohol, Washing, Violence etc.

Phobia (Phobia [target])
A more powerful ability of the Setites affinity with madness this allows 
them to cause a target to develop a severe (crippling?) fear of a certain 
thing - Water, the police etc.

Corruption (Corrupt [target])
A far more powerful form of the level six temptation this virtually 
ensures that the targets beast will quickly take control of their psyche.

Mark of Damnation (Mark [target])
It is rumoured that Set himself could inscribe a rune on the head of a 
victim causing all who saw it to revile him/her.

striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

0 STATUS~
This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

0 THAUMATURGY~
THAUMATURGY
Few Kindred are able to practice the rigourous discipline of 
Thaumaturgy.  This is the practice of blood magic, and is largely the 
province of the Tremere clan, who created it and guard it's secrets 
jealously.


Taste for blood (Taste)
This will give the Tremere who tastes another's vitae the ability to 
mystically sense details about that person.  These details include such 
things as blood, Generation etc.

Blood Rage (Bloodrage [Target])
This reduces the blood pool of an opposing vampire which in turn lessens 
their ability to use that blood offensively.  It also has the unfortunate 
side effect of sending the target into a furious frenzy - this means that 
it is an ability which must be used carefully.

Blood Potency (Potency)
With this ability a Tremere can, for a short period only, increase the 
potency of his blood so that his generation is effectively reduced for 
all intents and purposes.

Theft of Vitae (Theft [Target])
At this level of skill a Tremere can steal blood from the veins of 
another creature without the need for any physical contact.  This is 
damaging to living creatures and reduces the power of vampires by 
reducing their temporary blood pool.

Cauldron of Blood (Cauldron [Target] {Blood})
The most feared of all Tremere powers this actually boils the blood of 
the target which invariably kill's mortal's and does great damage to 
vampires as well as seriously reducing the amount of blood they have.
The more blood that is expended by the Tremere the more damage is done 
and blood stolen.  Thus the elder Tremere with their large blood pool's 
are incredibly powerful if they choose to use this power.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~
Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>
Syntax: blindfold <target>

TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.

Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the 
second, 30000 for the third, and so on.

immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, 
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Fangs       - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
* Bite        - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.
* Order       - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
* Introduce   - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk    - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Regenerate  - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
* Feed        - For feeding other vampires with your blood.
* Favour      - Make a vampire a Prince, allow them to sire a childe, accepts 
                or inducts them into the clan, or outcasts them from the clan.
* Clandisc    - Shows the amount of certain disc you have already attained. 
* Embrace     - Embrace a mob for blood, Embrace [<MoB>], should
                punch then embrace that mob, its easier.
* Power       - Shows exactly what power that you have attained in the certain
                discipline.
* vampring    - Create blood ring.  Cost is 60 primal.
* vampplate   - Create blood plate.  Cost is 60 primal.
* vamphelmet  - Create blood helmet.  Cost is 60 primal.

In addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant 
one or more extra powers.  For more information type 'help disciplines'.

your message.

0 VICISSITUDE~
The Tzimisce have though a pact with dark forces aquired the discipline

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~

0 WEAKEN~
Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two points.

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~
At the beginning of things, Gaia - the world and the spirit that embodies 
it - set all things in a balance that would maintain and encourage life.  
Near the top of this chain of being was humanity, and above them were the 
Garou - the sacred warriors of the spirit.  They were appointed to be the 
crusaders against the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans.  
They are the preservers of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity 
and purity.  They are the Earth's immune system, fighting the disease of 
the Wyrm.  They are the werewolves, and they fight and destroy the 
children of the Wyrm (such as the vampires) at every opportunity.

* Claw - Transforms target into a werewolf, but costs 10000 exp. 
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your werewolf lineage.
* Howl - A special channel that only werewolves can understand.

powers.  For more information, type 'help gifts'.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
